# Module_Six_World_Weather_Analysis

## Purpose
Add weather descriptions to the weather data already retrieved in this module. Then, have the beta testers use input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. From the list of potential travel destinations, the beta tester will choose four cities to create a travel itinerary. Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, create a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.
